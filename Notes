# Lists are arrays of python. they can contain any type of data. List can have lists within lists
# range() function returns a LIST
# We can create an empty list like: car = list() and then add stuff using list.append(<thing to add>)

# We use numpy for arrays (numerical py). Used to do complex operations quickly and easier
# import numpy as np | np is alias -> np.__ calling a function from numpy
# If arr=[(1,2,3),(4,5,6),(7,8,9)], so printing arr[1:5] will give 4,5,6 and 7,8,9. Upper bound in range can be >len but
it will print only up till current length of the array
